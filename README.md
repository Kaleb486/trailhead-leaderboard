# Trailhead Leaderboard

A Salesforce Trailhead leaderboard to track your team's progress. Built using Lightning Web Components.

## Description

This is a simple app that displays Trailhead users on a leaderboard table using Salesforce Lightning
Web Components. The bulk of the work happens in a scheduled Apex class that calls out to a custom
Trailhead API. This API pulls back profile data and inserts it into your Salesforce org in a custom
Object named `Trailblazer__c`. The page simply queries for and displays the `Trailblazer__c` records.
Users can add themselves to the leaderboard by clicking "Add New" at the top of the page.

## Installation

You can deploy this using the [Salesforce SFDX CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)
or [convert it to metadata](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_source.htm)
and use the [Force.com Migration Tool](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.daas.meta/daas/forcemigrationtool_install.htm).

>**Note:** The latest version of the leaderboard uses a [middleware API that I've built](https://github.com/meruff/go-trailhead-leaderboard-api) to call directly in the Trailhead API to get Profile data. If Salesforce decides to update/change the data on the Trailhead site this could break at any time. This site must be set up as a remote site in your Salesforce org in order for callouts to work.

## Usage

### Adding New Trailblazers

To add new Users to the leaderboard, you'll need to first ensure their Trailhead profile is public.
In the "About Me" section at the bottom of their profile, click the Edit icon in the top right and
check "Profile Public", then create a custom handle, if you haven't already. Now all you have to do
is enter your handle into the field on the Leaderboard by clicking "Add New" at the top right. The page will automatically pull in the User's data and upsert a new `Trailblazer__c` record for them.

### Scheduling

You can schedule `PopulateTrailblazers.cls` to run at various intervals to update your
`Trailblazer__c` by simply going to *Setup > Custom Code > Apex Classes > Schedule Apex*.
Give your job a name, select `PopulateTrailblazers.cls` as your Apex class, and choose a run
date/time.

Or, you can simply execute the batch manually from anonymous Apex:

``` java
Database.executeBatch(new PopulateTrailblazers());
```

The batch class enqueues a job for each `Trailblazer__c` in your org. For each queued job, it calls out to my middleware and updates the `Trailblazer__c` record's data. 5 jobs are enqueued at a time (limit for dev orgs). After that it schedules a new batch to run for the next five while removing the previous `Trailblazer__c` from the queue until its finished.

### Update From an Older Version

>**Note:** This is only relevant if you have an older version of the leaderboard that no longer works since Trailhead has updated to Lightning Web Components and I've introduced my own middleware API.

Salesforce has updated Trailhead to use custom User handles now instead of Profile Ids, which the old leaderboard used to get User data, which is one of the reasons why a new middleware that retrieved data differently was required. If you prefer to clone the repo and host your own Heroku instance of the app, or build your own, you are free to do so.

There's a new field on `Trailblazer__c` called `Profile_Handle__c` that all callouts use to get data from the API, so you'll need to populate this for all your users. One way to do this would be to run some anonymous Apex code to parse the custom handle out of the `Profile_Link__c` field. In this example I'm parsing the handle after `'/id/'`, but older versions of the leaderboard also used `'/me/'`.

``` java
List<Trailblazer__c> trailblazersToUpdate = new List<Trailblazer__c>();

for (Trailblazer__c tb : [SELECT Profile_Link__c FROM Trailblazer__c]) {
    tb.Profile_Handle__c = tb.Profile_Link__c.substringAfter('/id/');
    trailblazersToUpdate.add(tb);
}

update trailblazersToUpdate;
```

Another way would be to just manually populate the `Profile_Handle__c` field for all your `Trailblazer__c` records in your org, the choice is up to you. The rest of the data will updated automatically once you run the `PopulateTrailblazers` batch.

## Roadmap

- ~~Add Badges~~
- ~~Move from Bootstrap 3 to Salesforce Lightning Design System~~
- ~~Test/Mock Classes~~
- ~~Convert to Lightning Web Components âš¡~~
- ~~Convert to Salesforce DX Project~~
- ~~Add a custom Trailhead API~~
- Re-enable badges for orgs who want to use the storage space, possibly with a custom config to turn it on/off. Off by default.
